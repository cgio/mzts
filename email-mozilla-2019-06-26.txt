Hello from Mozilla's Trust & Security Team,

As promised, we wanted to follow-up on your email with feedback on our privacy notices.  Our Legal team has added your suggestions to our list of changes to consider as we update our notices going forward.  We plan to make updates in preparation for the California Consumer Privacy Act so reviews will be underway in the coming weeks.

With respect to a page describing Chrome practices in comparison to Firefox, we do know that our marketing team has been discussing potential ways to make some of these differences more transparent to our users and our advocacy and policy teams have also been thinking about what, if anything, we can or should do - such as blog posts or other options. 

We also wanted to let you know (in case you weren't aware) that if you are interested in these type of governance questions and sharing your ideas more broadly, you can join our governance group. 

 We are always looking for ways to improve and make our notices clear, readable and understandable and it is helpful for us to hear your thoughts.  Thank you again for your suggestions and comments.
